# docker-practice
A repository to keep track of my docker learning and implementation

## To cover
1. Docker Basics
- Installation & Setup (Docker CLI, Docker Desktop) ✅ 
- Basic Commands (docker run, docker ps, docker stop, docker rm, docker images, etc.) ✅ 
- Dockerfile (Writing efficient Dockerfiles for Node.js ✅, Python, etc.) ✅ 
- Docker Compose (Managing multi-container applications) ✅  

2. Containerizing Backend Applications
- Building a Docker Image for your Express.js backend ✅ 
- Using Environment Variables in Docker ✅ 
- Exposing Ports & Networking between services ✅ 
- Mounting Volumes for persistent data ✅ 
- Optimizing Dockerfiles (multi-stage builds, minimizing image size) ✅ 
- Connecting to Databases in Docker (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis) ✅ 

3. Docker Networking & Security
- Docker Networks (Bridge, Host, Overlay)
- Securing Containers (non-root users, secrets management)
- Limiting Resources (CPU, RAM, memory constraints)

4. Docker in CI/CD & Deployment
- Building & Pushing Images to Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry
- Docker with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- Deploying Containers in Production (AWS ECS, Azure Containers, Kubernetes)

5. Orchestration (Optional but Useful for Scaling AI Apps)
- Intro to Kubernetes (K8s) (Pods, Deployments, Services)
- Docker Swarm (if not using Kubernetes)
